# Documentation link checker 

A GitHub workflow that checks for broken links in our documentation, public GitHub readmes, and our website.

* Run periodically every day.
* You can start the workflow manually from inside **Actions**.
* Failed runs send a notification to the `#integrations-notifications` Slack channel. Once we fix all links and stabilize the workflow, we can send the notification to the `#documentation` channel.
* The latest results are deployed to GitHub pages of this repository.

## Limitations

> [!WARNING]  
> While useful, this is just an internal prototype and a work in progress. 

* Fingerprint.com is only checked for links to our resources and GitHub, external links trigger too many false positives for now.
* Link [text fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Fragment/Text_fragments) are not checked.
* Code quality, test coverage and CI does not meet production standards.
* Github `#L{number}` links still cause false positives sometimes.

## Motivation

There are obviously many libraries and services (we also use a weekly check by [TripleChecker.com](https://www.triplechecker.com/)) to check for broken links but I haven't found one that works well for documentation. They all just check the link's response status code and call it a day.

But documentation often contains anchor links like [https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/quick-start-guide#1-create-an-account](https://dev.fingerprint.com/docs/quick-start-guide#1-create-an-account) that point to specific section of our or eternal documentation that are broken despite returning `200 OK`. Hash links break far more easily that normal links: sub-headlines can change over time and there is usually no warning or redirect mechanism applied.

So a proper documentation link checker must:  
* Parse the returned page and check that hash element actually exists on the page. This must also work for common edge cases like: 
  * Client-side rendered pages (a headless browser is needed).
  * GitHub links pointing to specific lines in the code, like [https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/package.json#L3-L5](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs/blob/master/package.json#L3-L5)
* Must be able to run on-demand so you can change a subtitle and check right away if that breaks any links across all our resources.

## To-do

[x] Combine artifact outputs
[x] Deploy to GitHub pages
[x] Enable Slack notifications
[x] Nice Readme
[ ] Run tests in CI
[ ] Move repository
[ ] Add more tests for everything
[ ] Nicer report styling
[ ] Add `eslint`/`biome`
[ ] Copy link to clipboard in the report 
[ ] Improve performance
[ ] Provide a reusable GitHub action for checking `.md` files from inside a repository.
[ ] Make progress bar actually display progress inside GitHub actions UI
[ ] Improve API and documentation to make this potentially releasable on NPM as a utility package
